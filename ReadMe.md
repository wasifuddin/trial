### *What is Employee Motivation?*

Employee motivation means the *reasons why people work hard*. It includes:

* *Internal forces* ‚Äì like wanting to do a good job or enjoying the work.
* *External factors* ‚Äì like getting paid, winning an award, or getting praised.

---

### *Are Some People Naturally More Motivated?*

Yes! Psychologists believe *some people are more likely to be motivated* than others. This depends on three things:

1. *Self-esteem* ‚Äì how good they feel about themselves.
2. *Intrinsic motivation* ‚Äì how much they enjoy the work itself.
3. *Need for achievement* ‚Äì how much they want to succeed and be the best.

---

## üîπ 1. *Self-Esteem*

*Self-esteem* is how much a person *values or believes in themselves.*
If you feel confident and believe you are capable, you are likely to try harder and perform better at work.

### ‚úÖ Example:

Sarah is a new employee in a call center. She believes she‚Äôs good at talking to people. Because of this confidence (high self-esteem), she handles customers well and performs better.

---

### üî∏ *Types of Self-Esteem:*

1. *Chronic self-esteem* ‚Äì your general confidence in life.
   ‚û§ Example: John always believes he can solve any problem, no matter what.

2. *Situational self-esteem* (also called *self-efficacy*) ‚Äì confidence in specific situations.
   ‚û§ Example: Maria feels confident when using Excel but nervous during presentations.

3. *Socially influenced self-esteem* ‚Äì how much others‚Äô opinions affect your confidence.
   ‚û§ Example: When Mark‚Äôs manager praises him, he feels more confident and performs better.

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è How Can Companies Increase Self-Esteem?

#### 1. *Self-Esteem Workshops*

* Employees learn to see their strengths and think positively.
* This builds their confidence.

*Example:*
A retail store runs a workshop where staff write down what they‚Äôre good at. They discover talents they didn‚Äôt know they had and feel better about themselves.

---

#### 2. *Experience with Success*

* Give employees small tasks they are likely to succeed at.
* This builds confidence through success.
* This is called the *Galatea Effect* (belief in oneself leads to success).

*Example:*
A new warehouse worker is first given easy tasks. He finishes them successfully, feels confident, and then handles harder tasks more effectively.

---

#### 3. *Supervisor Behavior*

* Managers show belief in employees‚Äô abilities.
* Employees then start to believe in themselves.
* This is called the *Pygmalion Effect* (others' belief in you boosts your own confidence).

*Example:*
A manager tells an intern, ‚ÄúI know you can handle this client report.‚Äù The intern feels motivated, does the task well, and starts gaining confidence.

---

## üîπ 2. *Intrinsic Motivation*

*Intrinsic motivation* means doing a job because *you enjoy it* or like the challenge ‚Äì not because of money or rewards.

### ‚úÖ Example:

Alex is a software developer who loves solving coding puzzles. Even if there‚Äôs no bonus, he works late to finish a challenging task because he enjoys it.

---

### üî∏ *Extrinsic Motivation*

This is when you *don‚Äôt enjoy the task* but do it for a *reward* or to avoid punishment.

### ‚úÖ Example:

Lisa works overtime in a factory not because she likes it, but because she‚Äôll get extra pay.

### 1. *Need for Achievement (nAch)*

*What it means:*

* These people want to *do well*, *solve problems*, and *reach goals*.
* They like *challenging tasks* where they can take *personal responsibility* and see *clear results*.
* They prefer tasks that are *not too easy or too hard*.

*Work example:*

* Sarah is a marketing executive. She loves taking on new product launches because she can test her skills and measure the success of her strategies.
* She sets goals for herself like "Increase sales by 20% in 3 months" and works hard to achieve them.
* She doesn‚Äôt like tasks that are boring or have no clear purpose.

---

### 2. *Need for Affiliation (nAff)*

*What it means:*

* These people want to *build friendly relationships* and *be part of a team*.
* They feel happy when they *work with others* and help people.
* They *avoid conflict* and want to be *liked* by others.

*Work example:*

* Tom works in Human Resources. He enjoys training new employees and helping coworkers solve their problems.
* He prefers team projects where people work closely together.
* Tom avoids arguments and prefers to create a positive work environment.

---

### 3. *Need for Power (nPow)*

*What it means:*

* These people want to *influence or control* others and *make an impact*.
* They like to be in *leadership positions* and make decisions.
* There are two types:

  * *Personal power:* Want power for personal gain.
  * *Institutional (or social) power:* Want to lead teams and help the company grow.

*Work example:*

* Priya is a team leader in a software company. She loves leading meetings, making key decisions, and guiding her team to success.
* She feels motivated when she gets to influence how things are done.
* She enjoys being recognized as a leader and wants to move up to higher positions.

### Why This Is Useful at Work:

* *Managers* can use this theory to assign the right tasks to the right people.
* Employees feel more *motivated*, *happy*, and *productive* when their work matches their *main need*.
* For example, giving a high-achievement person a boring task will *demotivate* them, while giving a high-affiliation person a solo task might make them feel *lonely*.
